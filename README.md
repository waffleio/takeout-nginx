takeout-nginx
=============

This is the nginx container used in Waffle Takeout.

### For development
The [rebuild.sh](rebuild.sh) and [restart-all.sh](restart-all.sh) commands are only used in dev, just for the convenience of rapidly rebuilding the docker image and restarting other dependent images.
